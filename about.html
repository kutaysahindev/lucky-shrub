        <p>
          Welcome to Lucky Shrub, a medium-sized garden design firm specializing
          in garden design, creation, maintenance, and landscaping. Nestled in
          the scenic landscape of Taos, New Mexico, Lucky Shrub also operates as
          a small plant nursery, offering a comprehensive solution for clients
          looking to "transform any space into an oasis they can be proud of."
        </p>
        <p>
          Lucky Shrub was founded by a passionate husband and wife team, Jason
          and Maria, who share a deep-rooted love for plants. Jason, the garden
          architect, is the creative force behind all our designs and oversees
          our dedicated team of landscapers. Meanwhile, Maria leads the
          company's marketing efforts and manages the nursery, ensuring our
          clients have access to a wide array of indoor and outdoor plants.
